        I’m an ambitious, data driven nerd with creative roots and proven leadership skill. I’m earned a B.A. in Business Economics from Beloit College and an A.A.magna cum laude in Liberal Studies from Landmark College where I was honored to be elected Treasurer of the Phi Theta Kappa honors society.

        A fiend for competition, I adore playing sports and competitive gaming. In college I walked on to the soccer team and was invited to come back and coach after graduation. It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life as I was able to foster a relentless attitude in my young players and work with some of my former peers to apply meta analysis to their own games.

        By the end of that season I had also risen to the top 1% of gamers on the continent in my respective title and played my first season of semi-professional Esport, before long I began coaching players from all walks of life and developed a team of my own. Through multiple iterations and seasons we made a brand for ourselves and have begun running and broadcasting tournaments of our own.
